## How the System Works

### Customer Flow

```
1. Admin uploads customers via Excel → Customers created as unverified
2. Customer visits /verify-account
3. Customer enters phone number
4. Customer indicates if they have shipping mark:
   
   Option A - Has Shipping Mark:
   → Enter shipping mark
   → System searches cargo database
   → Shows matching cargo items
   → Customer confirms
   → Sets password
   → Account verified ✅
   
   Option B - No Shipping Mark:
   → Proceeds directly to password setup
   → Sets password
   → Account verified ✅

5. Auto-login with JWT tokens
6. Redirect to customer dashboard
```

### Technical Flow

```
Frontend (VerifyAccount.tsx)
    ↓ POST phone + shipping_mark
Backend (ShippingMarkVerificationView)
    ↓ Query CargoItem table
    ↓ Find matching items by shipping_mark
    ↓ Return cargo items list
Frontend
    ↓ Display cargo items table
    ↓ Customer reviews and confirms
    ↓ POST phone + shipping_mark + password
Backend (ShippingMarkConfirmationView)
    ↓ Validate shipping mark matches account
    ↓ Set password (hashed)
    ↓ Set is_verified = True
    ↓ Generate JWT tokens
    ↓ Return tokens + user data
Frontend
    ↓ Store tokens in localStorage
    ↓ Redirect to dashboard
```

## API Endpoints

### 1. Verify Shipping Mark
```
POST /api/auth/verify/shipping-mark/

Request:
{
  "phone": "+233123456789",
  "has_shipping_mark": true,
  "shipping_mark": "PM 001"
}

Response (Success):
{
  "success": true,
  "shipping_mark_verified": true,
  "user": {...},
  "cargo_items": [...],
  "total_items": 5
}
```

### 2. Confirm & Set Password
```
POST /api/auth/verify/shipping-mark/confirm/

Request:
{
  "phone": "+233123456789",
  "shipping_mark": "PM 001",
  "password": "SecurePass123",
  "confirm_password": "SecurePass123"
}

Response (Success):
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Account verified successfully!",
  "user": {...},
  "tokens": {
    "access": "...",
    "refresh": "..."
  }
}
```

## Security Features

1. ✅ Only unverified accounts can use these endpoints
2. ✅ Shipping mark must match account's registered mark
3. ✅ Password validation (min 8 characters)
4. ✅ Phone number validation
5. ✅ JWT tokens generated for secure auth
6. ✅ Passwords hashed with Django's built-in hasher
7. ✅ Protection against already-verified accounts

## Database Schema Used

### CustomerUser Model
- `phone` - Unique identifier
- `shipping_mark` - Unique cargo identifier
- `is_verified` - Boolean flag (False by default)
- `password` - Hashed password

### CargoItem Model
- `client` - Foreign key to CustomerUser
- `tracking_id` - Unique tracking number
- `container` - Foreign key to CargoContainer
- `item_description` - Item details

## Testing

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Start Django Server**
   ```bash
   py manage.py runserver
   ```

2. **Create Test Customer** (via Excel upload or admin panel)
   - Phone: +233123456789
   - Shipping Mark: PM 001
   - is_verified: False

3. **Create Test Cargo Items** (with matching shipping mark)
   - Client: The test customer
   - Shipping Mark: PM 001

4. **Test Frontend**
   - Navigate to http://localhost:5173/verify-account
   - Enter phone: +233123456789
   - Select "Yes, I have a shipping mark"
   - Enter: PM 001
   - Click Continue
   - Review cargo items
   - Set password
   - Click Verify Account

5. **Verify Success**
   - Check database: is_verified = True
   - Check password is hashed
   - Check JWT tokens received
   - Check redirect to dashboard

### Automated Testing
```bash
python test_verification_system.py
```

## Next Steps to Complete

1. **Start Django Server**
   ```bash
   cd primepre-logistics-system
   py manage.py runserver
   ```

2. **Start Frontend Dev Server**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test the System**
   - Visit http://localhost:5173/verify-account
   - Test with an unverified customer account

4. **Optional: Send Notifications**
   - Add email/SMS to notify customers about verification
   - Include link to /verify-account page

## Future Enhancements

1. Email/SMS notifications with verification link
2. QR code for quick verification
3. Bulk verification by admin
4. Verification expiry timer
5. Multi-language support
6. Two-factor authentication
7. Social login integration

## Deployment Notes

When deploying to production:

1. Update API URLs in frontend (remove localhost)
2. Set CORS headers properly
3. Use HTTPS for security
4. Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
5. Set up monitoring/logging
6. Create backup/restore procedures
7. Test with real data first

## Support & Troubleshooting

**Issue: Shipping mark not found**
- Solution: Check spelling, verify cargo items exist in database

**Issue: Already verified error**
- Solution: User should use regular login, not verification

**Issue: Password too weak**
- Solution: Must be at least 8 characters

**Issue: Phone not found**
- Solution: Contact admin to check if customer was uploaded
