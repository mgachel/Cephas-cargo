# Shipping Mark Selection Feature - Implementation Guide

## Overview
Implemented a new user signup flow where users select their preferred shipping mark from 4 auto-generated options based on their first and last names, instead of being assigned a default shipping mark.

## What Was Changed

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. New Page: `ShippingMarkSelection.tsx`
**Location:** `frontend/src/pages/ShippingMarkSelection.tsx`

**Features:**
- Displays 4 unique shipping mark suggestions based on user's name
- Allows user to select their preferred shipping mark
- Provides a "Generate New Options" button to refresh suggestions
- Auto-selects the first option by default
- Handles edge case where a selected mark is taken by another user
- Beautiful UI with cards and hover effects

**Key Functions:**
- `generateSuggestions()` - Fetches 4 shipping mark options from backend
- `handleSubmit()` - Completes signup with selected shipping mark
- `handleRefresh()` - Generates new suggestions if user doesn't like current options

#### 2. Updated: `SimplifiedSignup.tsx`
**Changes:**
- Modified to collect basic user info (name, email, phone, password, region)
- Redirects to `/signup/select-shipping-mark` instead of creating account directly
- Passes signup data via React Router state

#### 3. Updated: `App.tsx`
**Added new route:**
```tsx
<Route path="/signup/select-shipping-mark" element={<ShippingMarkSelection />} />
```

#### 4. Updated: `config.ts`
**Fixed URL normalization:**
- Added automatic removal of trailing slashes from `apiBaseUrl`
- Prevents double slash issues in API calls

#### 5. Updated: `.env.local`
**Fixed:**
- Removed trailing slash from `VITE_API_BASE_URL`
- Now: `http://localhost:8000` (was `http://localhost:8000/`)

### Backend Changes

#### 1. New View: `GenerateShippingMarksView`
**Location:** `users/views.py`

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/auth/generate-shipping-marks/`

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "first_name": "John",
  "last_name": "Doe",
  "company_name": "ABC Corp" // optional
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "suggestions": [
    "PM JD-001",
    "PM DOE-J",
    "PM JOHN-D",
    "PM JD-XYZ"
  ],
  "message": "Shipping mark suggestions generated successfully"
}
```

**Algorithm:**
Generates 4 unique shipping marks using various combinations:
1. First initial + Last initial + random number
2. Last name + First initial
3. First name + Last initial
4. First initial + Last initial + random suffix

All suggestions:
- Start with "PM " prefix
- Are checked for uniqueness in database
- Are formatted consistently
- Never duplicate existing marks

#### 2. New View: `SignupWithShippingMarkView`
**Location:** `users/views.py`

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/auth/signup/with-shipping-mark/`

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "first_name": "John",
  "last_name": "Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "phone": "+1234567890",
  "region": "US",
  "password": "SecurePass123!",
  "shipping_mark": "PM JD-001",
  "nickname": "JD", // optional
  "company_name": "ABC Corp", // optional
  "user_type": "INDIVIDUAL" // optional
}
```

**Response (Success):**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Account created successfully",
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "id": 123,
      "first_name": "John",
      "last_name": "Doe",
      "email": "john@example.com",
      "phone": "+1234567890",
      "region": "US",
      "shipping_mark": "PM JD-001",
      "user_role": "customer",
      "user_type": "INDIVIDUAL",
      "is_verified": true
    },
    "tokens": {
      "access": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJh...",
      "refresh": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJh..."
    }
  }
}
```

**Response (Shipping Mark Taken):**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "shipping_mark_taken",
  "message": "This shipping mark was just taken. Please select another one."
}
```

**Security Features:**
- Uses database transaction for atomicity
- Validates shipping mark format (must start with "PM ")
- Checks for duplicate email, phone, and shipping mark
- Validates region against allowed choices
- Auto-verifies user (no SMS required)
- Returns JWT tokens for immediate login

#### 3. Updated: `users/urls.py`
**Added new URL patterns:**
```python
path('generate-shipping-marks/', GenerateShippingMarksView.as_view(), name='generate_shipping_marks'),
path('signup/with-shipping-mark/', SignupWithShippingMarkView.as_view(), name='signup_with_shipping_mark'),
```

## User Flow

### Old Flow (Before)
1. User fills signup form
2. System automatically generates shipping mark
3. User is logged in

### New Flow (After)
1. User fills basic signup form (name, email, phone, password, region)
2. User is redirected to shipping mark selection page
3. System generates 4 unique shipping mark suggestions
4. User selects their preferred mark (or generates new options)
5. User clicks "Complete Signup"
6. Account is created with selected shipping mark
7. User is logged in and redirected to dashboard

## Edge Cases Handled

1. **Shipping Mark Already Taken:**
   - If selected mark is taken between generation and submission
   - Backend returns `shipping_mark_taken` error
   - Frontend automatically generates new suggestions
   - User is notified with a toast message

2. **Invalid Shipping Mark Format:**
   - Backend validates format (must start with "PM ")
   - Returns error if invalid

3. **User Doesn't Like Suggestions:**
   - "Generate New Options" button fetches 4 new suggestions
   - Can be clicked unlimited times

4. **Navigation Without Data:**
   - If user navigates directly to selection page without signup data
   - Redirected back to signup page

## API Endpoints Summary

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/api/auth/generate-shipping-marks/` | POST | Generate 4 shipping mark suggestions |
| `/api/auth/signup/with-shipping-mark/` | POST | Complete signup with selected mark |
| `/api/auth/signup/simplified/` | POST | Legacy endpoint (still works) |

## Testing

### Test the Complete Flow:
1. Navigate to signup page: `http://localhost:5173/signup`
2. Fill in all required fields
3. Click "Create Account"
4. Should redirect to shipping mark selection
5. View 4 unique suggestions
6. Click "Generate New Options" to test refresh
7. Select a mark and click "Complete Signup"
8. Should be logged in and redirected to dashboard

### Test Edge Cases:
1. **Duplicate Shipping Mark:**
   - Create user with a specific mark
   - Try to select same mark in new signup
   - Should generate new suggestions

2. **Missing Data:**
   - Navigate directly to `/signup/select-shipping-mark`
   - Should redirect to signup page

## Benefits

1. **User Control:** Users choose their identity/brand
2. **Personalization:** Marks based on their actual name
3. **Professional:** Consistent "PM " prefix for all marks
4. **Unique:** All 4 suggestions are guaranteed unique
5. **Flexible:** Users can refresh for new options
6. **Secure:** Transaction-based to prevent duplicates

## Future Enhancements

1. Allow custom shipping mark input (with validation)
2. Show mark availability in real-time
3. Add shipping mark preview in different formats
4. Suggest marks based on company name if provided
5. Add favorites/saved marks for future reference

## Deployment Notes

### Environment Variables Required:
- `VITE_API_BASE_URL` - Should NOT have trailing slash

### Database:
- No migrations required (uses existing `shipping_mark` field)

### Dependencies:
- No new packages required
- Uses existing React Router, Axios, and UI components
