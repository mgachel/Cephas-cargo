# Continuous Item Addition Feature - Update

## Change Summary
Modified the "Add Shipping Mark Group" dialog to allow continuous item addition without closing the dialog after each save.

## What Changed

### Before:
- Add multiple items → Click "Save Items" → Dialog closes
- Had to reopen dialog to add more items for same shipping mark

### After:
- Add items → Click "Save & Add More" → **Dialog stays open**
- Form clears but shipping mark remains selected
- Can keep adding items until user clicks "Finish & Close"
- Shows count of items already saved

## New Workflow

1. **Select Shipping Mark** - Choose client once
2. **Add Item(s)** - Enter item details (can add one or multiple)
3. **Save & Add More** - Saves current items, clears form, stays open
4. **Repeat** - Keep adding items for the same shipping mark
5. **Finish & Close** - When done, close the dialog

## UI Updates

### Dialog Title
- Now shows badge with count of saved items
- Example: "Add Items for PM001" with "5 saved" badge

### Footer Display
- **Current Batch**: Shows totals for items in current form
- **Already Saved**: Shows count with green checkmark (✓ 5 items already saved)

### Button Changes
1. **"Save & Add More"** (Primary button)
   - Replaces "Save Items"
   - Saves current items
   - Clears form
   - Keeps dialog open
   - Keeps shipping mark selected

2. **"Save & View Invoice"** (Secondary button)
   - Saves current items
   - Generates invoice with ALL saved items (including previous batches)
   - Closes dialog

3. **"Finish & Close"** (Previously "Cancel")
   - Changes label based on context:
     - "Cancel" if no items saved yet
     - "Finish & Close" if items already saved
   - Shows total count on close

## Benefits

### For Users:
- **Less clicking**: Don't need to reopen dialog repeatedly
- **Natural workflow**: Add items as they come without interruption
- **Progress visibility**: Always see how many items saved
- **Flexibility**: Can save items individually or in batches
- **Safety**: Items saved immediately, no risk of losing data

### For Data Integrity:
- Items are saved incrementally
- Less chance of session timeout issues
- Immediate feedback on successful saves
- Can recover if one batch fails without losing all work

## Technical Details

### State Management
- Added `savedItemsCount` state to track total items saved
- Increments after each successful save
- Resets on dialog close
- Used in UI to show progress

### Form Behavior
- After save: `setItems([createEmptyItem()])` - Creates fresh form
- Client selection persists across saves
- Step remains on 'add-items' (doesn't go back to client selection)

### Success Messages
- Individual save: "Successfully added X item(s) for SHIPPING_MARK"
- On close: "Total of X item(s) added for SHIPPING_MARK"

## Example Scenario

**Adding 10 items for shipping mark "PM001":**

**Old way:**
1. Open dialog → Select PM001 → Add 10 items → Save → Close
2. (If you forgot one) Open dialog → Select PM001 again → Add 1 item → Save → Close

**New way:**
1. Open dialog → Select PM001
2. Add 3 items → "Save & Add More" → ✓ 3 items saved
3. Add 4 items → "Save & Add More" → ✓ 7 items saved  
4. Add 2 items → "Save & Add More" → ✓ 9 items saved
5. Remember missed item → Add 1 item → "Save & Add More" → ✓ 10 items saved
6. "Finish & Close" → "Total of 10 items added for PM001"

## Code Changes
