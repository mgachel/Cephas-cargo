# ðŸš¢ Cargo Module Implementation Guide

## Overview
The Cargo Module has been implemented with three main submodules:
1. **Sea Cargo**
2. **Air Cargo** 
3. **Customer Shipments Page** (integrating with Claims module)

## ðŸ”‘ Key Features Implemented

### 1. Container Management
- **Create Container**: Users can create containers with all required details (Sea or Air)
- **Container Types**: `sea` and `air` cargo types supported
- **Container Details**: Load date, ETA, route, weight, CBM, rates, status tracking

### 2. Cargo Item Management
- **Add Items to Container**: After creating a container, users can add cargo items
- **Shipping Mark Integration**: Each cargo item belongs to a customer identified by their unique Shipping Mark
- **Client Field Display**: When adding cargo items, the client field shows only the Shipping Mark (not customer name)

### 3. Customer Shipments Page
The Customer Shipments Page automatically aggregates all items linked to a customer's Shipping Mark across 4 categories:

#### Categories:
1. **Goods Received (China)** - Items in China warehouse
2. **Goods Received (Ghana)** - Items in Ghana warehouse  
3. **Sea Cargo** - Items in sea containers
4. **Air Cargo** - Items in air containers

#### Auto-Sync Feature:
- When goods are added to warehouses and linked to a Shipping Mark, they automatically appear in the Customer Shipments Page
- When cargo items are added to containers and linked to a Shipping Mark, they automatically appear in the appropriate category (Sea/Air)

## ðŸ“Š Data Models

### CargoContainer
```python
container_id = CharField(unique=True, primary_key=True)
cargo_type = CharField(choices=['sea', 'air'])
weight = FloatField()
cbm = FloatField()
load_date = DateField()
eta = DateField()
unloading_date = DateField()
route = CharField()
rates = DecimalField()
stay_days = IntegerField()
delay_days = IntegerField()
status = CharField(choices=['pending', 'in_transit', 'delivered', 'demurrage'])
```

### CargoItem
```python
id = UUIDField(primary_key=True)
container = ForeignKey(CargoContainer)
client = ForeignKey(CustomerUser)  # Linked by shipping_mark
tracking_id = CharField(unique=True)
item_description = TextField()
quantity = IntegerField()
weight = FloatField()
cbm = FloatField()
unit_value = DecimalField()
total_value = DecimalField()
status = CharField(choices=['pending', 'in_transit', 'delivered', 'delayed'])
```

### CustomerUser (Shipping Mark)
```python
shipping_mark = CharField(unique=True)  # Auto-generated: PM{FIRSTNAME}{Counter}
# Example: PMJOHN01, PMJANE02, PMMIKE01
```

## ðŸ”„ Workflow Implementation

### 1. Container Creation
1. User creates a new container (Sea or Air)
2. Container gets unique ID and basic details
3. Status starts as 'pending'

### 2. Adding Cargo Items
1. User opens the container
2. Clicks "Add Item" 
3. In the popup:
   - **Client field shows only Shipping Marks** (e.g., PMJOHN01, PMJANE02)
   - User selects shipping mark from dropdown
   - Enters item details (description, quantity, CBM, weight, value)
4. System automatically:
   - Links item to customer via shipping mark
   - Generates tracking ID
   - Updates container summaries

### 3. Customer Shipments Auto-Sync
The Customer Shipments Page automatically shows:

#### Goods Received (China)
- All items in China warehouse with customer's shipping mark
- Status: PENDING â†’ READY_FOR_SHIPPING â†’ SHIPPED

#### Goods Received (Ghana)  
- All items in Ghana warehouse with customer's shipping mark
- Status: PENDING â†’ READY_FOR_DELIVERY â†’ DELIVERED

#### Sea Cargo
- All cargo items in sea containers with customer's shipping mark
- Status: pending â†’ in_transit â†’ delivered

#### Air Cargo
- All cargo items in air containers with customer's shipping mark
- Status: pending â†’ in_transit â†’ delivered

## ðŸ”§ Frontend Integration

### Container Management UI
```javascript
// Create Container
POST /api/cargo/containers/
{
  "container_id": "SEA001",
  "cargo_type": "sea",
  "load_date": "2024-12-30",
  "eta": "2025-01-15",
  "route": "China to Ghana"
}

// Add Cargo Item to Container
POST /api/cargo/containers/SEA001/add_cargo_item/
{
  "client_shipping_mark": "PMJOHN01",
  "item_description": "Electronics components",
  "quantity": 10,
  "cbm": 2.5,
  "weight": 150.0,
  "unit_value": 50.00,
  "total_value": 500.00
}
```

### Customer Shipments Page UI
```javascript
// Get Customer's All Shipments
GET /api/cargo/customer/shipments/
// Returns:
{
  "customer_info": {
    "shipping_mark": "PMJOHN01",
    "customer_name": "John Doe"
  },
  "goods_received_china": {
    "count": 5,
    "total_cbm": 12.5,
    "items": [...]
  },
  "goods_received_ghana": {
    "count": 2,
    "total_cbm": 4.2,
    "items": [...]
  },
  "sea_cargo": {
    "count": 8,
    "total_cbm": 15.3,
    "items": [...]
  },
  "air_cargo": {
    "count": 3,
    "total_cbm": 2.1,
    "items": [...]
  }
}
```

### Shipping Mark Dropdown
```javascript
// Get Shipping Marks for Dropdown
GET /api/cargo/shipping-marks/
// Returns:
[
  {"id": 1, "shipping_mark": "PMJOHN01"},
  {"id": 2, "shipping_mark": "PMJANE02"},
  {"id": 3, "shipping_mark": "PMMIKE01"}
]

// In UI, show only shipping marks:
<select name="client">
  <option value="1">PMJOHN01</option>
  <option value="2">PMJANE02</option>
  <option value="3">PMMIKE01</option>
</select>
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Implementation Points

### 1. Shipping Mark as Primary Identifier
- âœ… System generates unique shipping marks automatically
- âœ… Format: PM{FIRSTNAME}{Counter} (e.g., PMJOHN01, PMJANE02)
- âœ… All items linked via shipping mark, not customer name
- âœ… Client dropdowns show only shipping marks

### 2. Container â†’ Cargo Item Flow
- âœ… Create Container first
- âœ… Open container to view details
- âœ… Add cargo items within container
- âœ… Each item linked to shipping mark
- âœ… Auto-generate tracking IDs

### 3. Customer Shipments Auto-Sync
- âœ… Items automatically appear when linked to shipping mark
- âœ… Four categories: China, Ghana, Sea, Air
- âœ… Real-time aggregation by shipping mark
- âœ… Status tracking across all categories

### 4. Claims Integration
- âœ… Claims module can reference cargo items by tracking ID
- âœ… Claims linked to shipping marks for customer association
- âœ… Cross-module item tracking capabilities

## ðŸš€ Usage Examples

### Creating a Sea Container with Items
1. Create container: `POST /api/cargo/containers/`
2. Open container details: `GET /api/cargo/containers/SEA001/`
3. Add cargo item: `POST /api/cargo/containers/SEA001/add_cargo_item/`
4. Item appears in customer's Sea Cargo category automatically

### Customer Checking Their Shipments
1. Customer logs in with their account
2. Goes to Customer Shipments page
3. Sees all their items across 4 categories:
   - China warehouse goods
   - Ghana warehouse goods  
   - Sea cargo containers
   - Air cargo containers
4. Can track specific items by tracking ID

### Warehouse â†’ Cargo Flow
1. Goods arrive in China warehouse â†’ linked to PMJOHN01
2. Goods ready for shipping â†’ moved to sea container
3. Cargo item created in sea container â†’ linked to PMJOHN01
4. Customer sees item move from "China" to "Sea Cargo" category

This implementation fully satisfies the specification requirements with proper shipping mark integration, container management, and cross-module synchronization.
