## Monitor Deployment

### Render Dashboard
1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Select: `primepre-backend` service
3. Watch: Build logs for success
4. Verify: Service starts without errors

### Look For
```
✅ Build succeeded
✅ Starting service with gunicorn_config.py
✅ Server is ready. Spawning workers
✅ Worker spawned (pid: ...)
```

### Avoid
```
❌ Build failed
❌ Worker timeout
❌ Memory limit exceeded
```

---

## If Issues Occur

### Issue: Build Fails
**Check:** Git push completed successfully
**Fix:** Re-push or check Render logs

### Issue: Workers Timeout
**Cause:** Memory too high
**Fix:** Reduce batch size to 15-20 in `customer_excel_views.py`

### Issue: Still Getting 502
**Check:** 
1. Render logs for actual error
2. Database connection status
3. Memory usage in dashboard

**Contact:** Check `LARGE_CUSTOMER_UPLOAD_CONFIG.md` troubleshooting section

## Performance Tips

### For Best Results
1. ✅ Upload during off-peak hours
2. ✅ Clean data before upload (remove duplicates)
3. ✅ Validate phone numbers are correct format
4. ✅ Keep files under 7,000 customers when possible
5. ✅ Split very large files (>7K) into multiple uploads

### Memory-Saving Options
- Batch size can be reduced to 15-20 if issues persist
- Consider upgrading Render plan for >5K customers regularly
- Use database indexes on phone/shipping_mark fields
