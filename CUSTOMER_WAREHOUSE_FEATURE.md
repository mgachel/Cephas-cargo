# Customer Warehouse Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a customer-facing warehouse view that allows clients to see containers in the Ghana warehouse and view only their own goods within those containers.

## Backend Changes

### 1. New ViewSets (`GoodsRecieved/views.py`)

Added three new customer-facing viewsets:

#### `CustomerGoodsReceivedContainerViewSet`
- Read-only access to containers
- Filters containers to show only those containing items for the authenticated customer
- Provides statistics specific to customer's items

#### `CustomerGhanaSeaContainerViewSet`
- Extends the base customer container viewset
- Filters to Ghana Sea containers only

#### `CustomerGhanaAirContainerViewSet`
- Extends the base customer container viewset
- Filters to Ghana Air containers only

### 2. API Endpoints (`GoodsRecieved/urls.py`)

New customer endpoints added:
```
GET /api/goods/customer/ghana/sea_containers/          - List Ghana sea containers with customer's items
GET /api/goods/customer/ghana/sea_containers/{id}/     - Get specific container details
GET /api/goods/customer/ghana/sea_containers/{id}/items/ - Get customer's items in container
GET /api/goods/customer/ghana/sea_containers/statistics/ - Container statistics for customer

GET /api/goods/customer/ghana/air_containers/          - List Ghana air containers with customer's items
GET /api/goods/customer/ghana/air_containers/{id}/     - Get specific container details
GET /api/goods/customer/ghana/air_containers/{id}/items/ - Get customer's items in container
GET /api/goods/customer/ghana/air_containers/statistics/ - Container statistics for customer
```

### 3. Key Features

**Container Filtering:**
- Customers only see containers that have at least one item with their shipping mark
- Uses Django ORM `Exists` subquery for efficient filtering

**Item Filtering:**
- When viewing container details, only items matching the customer's shipping mark are shown
- Items are grouped by shipping mark (will only show customer's mark)

**Statistics:**
- Provides aggregated statistics based only on customer's items
- Includes total containers, items, weight, CBM, and status breakdowns

## Frontend Changes

### 1. Service Layer (`goodsReceivedContainerService.ts`)

Added new service methods:
- `getCustomerGhanaSeaContainers()` - Fetch customer's containers
- `getCustomerGhanaAirContainers()` - Fetch customer's air containers
- `getCustomerContainerById()` - Get specific container with customer's items
- `getCustomerContainerItems()` - Get customer's items in a container
- `getCustomerGhanaSeaStatistics()` - Get statistics
- `getCustomerGhanaAirStatistics()` - Get air statistics

### 2. New Pages

#### `CustomerWarehouse.tsx`
A customer-facing warehouse page that shows:
- List of all containers containing customer's goods
- Statistics dashboard (total containers, items, pending, ready, delivered)
- Search and filter functionality
- Container details on click

Features:
- Real-time data refresh
- Status filtering
- Search by container ID
- Responsive design with mobile support

#### `CustomerContainerDetailsPage.tsx`
Detailed view of a specific container showing:
- Container information (ID, arrival date, type, status)
- List of customer's items in the container
- Export to CSV functionality
- Print functionality
- Summary statistics (total weight, CBM, quantity)

### 3. Routing (`App.tsx`)

Added new customer routes:
```
/customer/warehouse                          - Main warehouse view
/customer/warehouse/container/:containerId   - Container details view
```

### 4. Navigation (`AppSidebar.tsx`)

Added "My Warehouse" link to customer navigation menu with Package icon.

## Security & Access Control

### Authentication
- All endpoints require authentication (`IsAuthenticated` permission)
- User's shipping mark is automatically extracted from the authenticated user

### Data Isolation
- Customers can only see:
  - Containers that have their items
  - Their own items within containers
  - Statistics based on their items only
- Admin functionality (create, edit, delete) is not available to customers

### Read-Only Access
- All customer container viewsets extend `ReadOnlyModelViewSet`
- No create, update, or delete operations allowed
- Customers can only view and export their data

## User Experience

### For Customers
1. Navigate to "My Warehouse" in the sidebar
2. View all containers containing their goods
3. See summary statistics at a glance
4. Search and filter containers by status
5. Click any container to see detailed item list
6. Export item lists to CSV
7. Print container details

### Data Display
- Container ID, Type (Sea/Air), Arrival Date, Route, Status
- Number of customer's items in each container
- Grouped item display by shipping mark
- Days in warehouse calculation
- Status badges with color coding

## Benefits

1. **Transparency**: Customers can see exactly where their goods are
2. **Self-Service**: No need to contact admin for basic warehouse info
3. **Real-Time**: Data refreshes on demand
4. **Organized**: Items grouped by container for easy tracking
5. **Printable**: Can print/export data for records
6. **Secure**: Only see their own data, properly isolated

## Technical Highlights

- **Efficient Queries**: Uses Django ORM's `Exists` and `prefetch_related` for optimized database queries
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript typing for all data structures
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- **Reusable Components**: Leverages existing DataTable and UI components

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions:
- Filter by container type (Sea/Air)
- Date range filtering
- Advanced search (by shipping mark, tracking number, etc.)
- Notifications when container status changes
- Delivery scheduling
- Direct communication with admin about specific containers
