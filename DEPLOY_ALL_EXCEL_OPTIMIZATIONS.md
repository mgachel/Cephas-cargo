## 🧪 Testing After Deployment

### 1. Monitor Deployment
Watch Render dashboard for:
```
✅ Build succeeded
✅ Starting service with gunicorn_config.py
✅ Server is ready. Spawning workers
✅ Worker spawned (pid: ...)
```

### 2. Test Customer Upload (Critical)
```bash
1. Go to: https://primepre-logistics-system.onrender.com
2. Navigate: Customer Management → Upload Excel
3. Upload: Test file with 5,000 customers
4. Verify:
   ✅ No 502 errors
   ✅ No CORS errors
   ✅ Completes in 40-60 seconds
   ✅ Shows: "Created X customers, Y failed"
```

### 3. Test Container Items
```bash
1. Go to: Container Details page
2. Click: Upload Excel
3. Upload: Test file with 1,000 items
4. Verify:
   ✅ Items matched to customers
   ✅ No timeout errors
   ✅ Proper error messages for unmatched
```

### 4. Test Goods Received
```bash
1. Go to: Goods Received page
2. Upload: Test file with 2,000 entries
3. Verify:
   ✅ All entries created
   ✅ Proper duplicate handling
   ✅ No memory issues
```

|----------|----------|----------|------------|
| `/api/auth/customers/excel/upload/` | 50MB | 10,000 | 25 |
| `/api/auth/customers/excel/bulk-create/` | - | 10,000 | 25 |

### Container Excel Uploads

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### For 4K-7K Customer Uploads (Your Use Case)
✅ **Perfect!** System is optimized for this range
- File size: ~1-1.5MB (well under 50MB limit)
- Processing time: 60-90 seconds
- Memory usage: ~120-150MB per worker
- Success rate: >99% with valid data

### For Extremely Large Files
If you need to upload >10,000 rows:
1. **Split the file** into multiple uploads
2. **Use batch processing** - upload 5,000 at a time
3. **Monitor memory** - consider upgrading Render plan
4. **Schedule uploads** - don't upload multiple large files simultaneously

### Memory Considerations
Render free tier has 512MB RAM:
```
System:        ~100MB
Database:      ~50MB  
Workers (2):   ~300MB (150MB each)
Buffer:        ~62MB
```

With 7,000 customer upload:
- Data in memory: ~2.5MB
- Django overhead: ~80MB
- Total per worker: ~150MB ✅ Safe!

---

## 🔍 Monitoring Tips

### Render Dashboard
Watch for:
- ✅ Memory usage <400MB
- ✅ No worker restarts
- ✅ Response times <120s
- ⚠️ If memory >450MB, reduce batch sizes

### Application Logs
Success indicators:
```
✅ "Processing 5000 customers in 200 batches of 25"
✅ "Batch 100/200 completed: 2,500/5,000 processed"
✅ "Successfully created 4,985 customers, 15 failed"
```

Warning indicators:
```
⚠️ "Large file detected: 8,500 rows"
⚠️ "Memory usage high: 420MB"
⚠️ "Processing slower than expected"
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still Getting 502 Errors

**Check:**
1. File size - is it >50MB?
2. Row count - is it >10,000?
3. Render logs - what's the actual error?

**Solution:**
```bash
# View Render logs
render logs -t 100 primepre-backend

# Look for:
- "Worker timeout"
- "Memory limit exceeded"
- "Database connection error"
```

### Issue: Upload is Very Slow

**Causes:**
- File at upper limit (10,000 rows)
- Complex validation logic
- Database under load

**Solutions:**
1. Split file into 2-3 smaller uploads
2. Upload during off-peak hours
3. Check database connection pool

### Issue: Partial Failures

**This is NORMAL!**
- Some rows may have invalid data
- Duplicates are skipped
- System continues processing

**Check Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "total_created": 4,985,
  "total_failed": 15,
  "failed_rows": [...]  ← Review these
}
```
