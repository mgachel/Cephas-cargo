# Customer Warehouse Feature Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a customer-facing warehouse view where clients can see containers in the Ghana warehouse and view only their own goods/shipping marks within those containers.

## Backend Changes

### 1. New ViewSets in `GoodsRecieved/views.py`

#### CustomerGoodsReceivedContainerViewSet
- **Purpose**: Read-only ViewSet for customers to view containers
- **Filtering**: Only shows containers that have items matching the customer's shipping mark
- **Key Features**:
  - List containers with customer's items
  - View container details
  - Get items filtered by customer's shipping mark
  - Statistics for containers with customer's items

#### CustomerGhanaSeaContainerViewSet
- **Purpose**: Customer view for Ghana Sea containers
- **Inherits**: CustomerGoodsReceivedContainerViewSet
- **Filtering**: Containers with location='ghana' and container_type='sea'

#### CustomerGhanaAirContainerViewSet  
- **Purpose**: Customer view for Ghana Air containers
- **Inherits**: CustomerGoodsReceivedContainerViewSet
- **Filtering**: Containers with location='ghana' and container_type='air'

### 2. URL Routes Added in `GoodsRecieved/urls.py`

```python
# Customer container views
customer_router.register(r'ghana/sea_containers', CustomerGhanaSeaContainerViewSet, basename='customer-ghana-sea-containers')
customer_router.register(r'ghana/air_containers', CustomerGhanaAirContainerViewSet, basename='customer-ghana-air-containers')
```

**API Endpoints Created**:
- `GET /api/goods/customer/ghana/sea_containers/` - List Ghana Sea containers with customer's items
- `GET /api/goods/customer/ghana/sea_containers/{id}/` - Get specific container details
- `GET /api/goods/customer/ghana/sea_containers/{id}/items/` - Get customer's items in container
- `GET /api/goods/customer/ghana/sea_containers/statistics/` - Get statistics for customer's items
- Similar endpoints for Air containers

## Frontend Changes

### 1. Service Layer (`goodsReceivedContainerService.ts`)

Added customer-specific methods:
- `getCustomerGhanaSeaContainers()` - Fetch Ghana Sea containers with customer's items
- `getCustomerGhanaAirContainers()` - Fetch Ghana Air containers with customer's items
- `getCustomerContainerById()` - Get container details (filtered items)
- `getCustomerContainerItems()` - Get customer's items in a container
- `getCustomerGhanaSeaStatistics()` - Get statistics for customer's containers
- `getCustomerGhanaAirStatistics()` - Get statistics for customer's containers

### 2. New Pages

#### CustomerWarehouse.tsx (`/customer/warehouse`)
- **Purpose**: Main warehouse page for customers
- **Features**:
  - Lists all Ghana Sea containers that have the customer's items
  - Shows statistics (total containers, items, status breakdown)
  - Search and filter by status
  - Click container to view details
  - Refresh functionality
- **View**: Similar to admin GoodsReceivedGhanaSea but customer-focused

#### CustomerContainerDetailsPage.tsx (`/customer/warehouse/container/:containerId`)
- **Purpose**: Detailed view of a specific container
- **Features**:
  - Shows only customer's items in the container
  - Container information (arrival date, type, status)
  - Items table with shipping mark, tracking, quantity, weight, CBM, days in warehouse
  - Export to CSV functionality
  - Print functionality
  - Back navigation to warehouse

### 3. Navigation Updates (`AppSidebar.tsx`)

Added "My Warehouse" link to customer navigation:
```tsx
{ name: "My Warehouse", href: "/customer/warehouse", icon: Package }
```

### 4. Routing Updates (`App.tsx`)

Added protected customer routes:
```tsx
<Route path="/customer/warehouse" element={...CustomerWarehouse} />
<Route path="/customer/warehouse/container/:containerId" element={...CustomerContainerDetailsPage} />
```

## Key Features

### Security
- ✅ Customers can only see containers with their items
- ✅ When viewing container details, only their shipping mark items are shown
- ✅ Backend filtering ensures data isolation
- ✅ Read-only access for customers

### Functionality
- ✅ View all containers with customer's goods
- ✅ Filter containers by status
- ✅ Search containers
- ✅ View detailed container information
- ✅ See only their own goods in each container
- ✅ Export items to CSV
- ✅ Print container details
- ✅ Real-time statistics

### User Experience
- ✅ Similar interface to admin view (familiar)
- ✅ Clear indication of "Your Items"
- ✅ Easy navigation between warehouse list and container details
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Loading states and error handling

## Data Flow

1. **Customer accesses `/customer/warehouse`**
   - Frontend calls `getCustomerGhanaSeaContainers()`
   - Backend filters to containers with customer's shipping mark
   - Returns container list with item counts

2. **Customer clicks on a container**
   - Navigates to `/customer/warehouse/container/{id}`
   - Frontend calls `getCustomerContainerItems(containerId)`
   - Backend filters items by customer's shipping mark
   - Returns only customer's items grouped by shipping mark

3. **Customer exports/prints**
   - Uses filtered data already loaded
   - Exports only their items to CSV or print view

## Benefits

1. **Transparency**: Customers can see their goods in the warehouse
2. **Self-Service**: No need to call admin to check status
3. **Efficiency**: Customers can track and print their own items
4. **Scalability**: Backend filtering ensures performance even with many items
5. **Security**: Complete data isolation between customers

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with multiple customers having items in same container
2. Verify customer A cannot see customer B's items
3. Test all status filters
4. Test search functionality
5. Test export and print features
6. Verify statistics accuracy
7. Test on mobile devices

## Future Enhancements

1. Add air cargo container view
2. Add ability to request delivery
3. Add item tracking history
4. Add notifications when container status changes
5. Add QR code scanning for quick access
6. Add bulk export for multiple containers
