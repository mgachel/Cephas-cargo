# Customer Cargo Feature Implementation

## Overview
Added "My Goods" section to customer dashboard allowing customers to view containers (sea and air) where their goods are located, mirroring the admin cargo dashboard but filtered to show only their items.

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend Pages Created

#### `frontend/src/pages/CustomerSeaCargo.tsx`
- Displays sea cargo containers containing customer's goods
- Features:
  - Search and filter by status
  - Dashboard statistics (total, in-transit, delivered, pending)
  - Data table with container details
  - Click to view container items
  - Refresh functionality

#### `frontend/src/pages/CustomerAirCargo.tsx`
- Displays air cargo containers containing customer's goods
- Same features as sea cargo page
- Adapted for air transport terminology (Flight vs Vessel)

### 2. Navigation Updates

#### `frontend/src/components/layout/AppSidebar.tsx`
Added "My Goods" section to customer navigation:
```typescript
{
  name: "My Goods",
  children: [
    { name: "Sea Cargo", href: "/customer/cargo/sea", icon: Ship },
    { name: "Air Cargo", href: "/customer/cargo/air", icon: Plane },
  ],
}
```

### 3. Routes Added

#### `frontend/src/App.tsx`
Added new customer-only routes:
- `/customer/cargo/sea` - Customer sea cargo list
- `/customer/cargo/air` - Customer air cargo list
- `/customer/cargo/sea/container/:containerId` - Sea container details
- `/customer/cargo/air/container/:containerId` - Air container details

All routes:
- Protected with `ProtectedRoute`
- Scoped with `RoleBasedRoute` (customer-only)
- Redirects admins to home

### 4. Service Methods Fixed

#### `frontend/src/services/cargoService.ts`
Rewrote customer cargo methods to:
- Call correct backend endpoints directly
- Handle errors gracefully
- Return empty results on failure (prevents crashes)
- Support proper filtering and pagination

Methods:
```typescript
- getCustomerSeaCargoContainers(filters)
- getCustomerAirCargoContainers(filters)
- getCustomerSeaCargoDashboard()
- getCustomerAirCargoDashboard()
- getCustomerContainerDetails(id)
- getCustomerContainerItems(containerId)
```

### 5. Backend Endpoints (Already Exist)

The following endpoints were already implemented:
- `GET /api/cargo/customer/containers/` - List customer's containers
- `GET /api/cargo/customer/containers/{id}/` - Get container details
- `GET /api/cargo/customer/containers/{id}/items/` - Get container items
- `GET /api/cargo/customer/dashboard/` - Get dashboard stats

Filters automatically applied:
- Only shows containers containing customer's items
- Filters by shipping_mark or client relationship
- Hides sensitive admin data (costs, internal notes)

## User Experience

### Customer Flow
1. Customer logs in
2. Navigates to "My Goods" → "Sea Cargo" or "Air Cargo"
3. Sees containers where their goods are located
4. Can search and filter by status
5. Clicks container to view their specific items
6. Views item details (tracking, description, quantity, CBM, weight)

### Data Visibility
**Customers Can See:**
- Container numbers and transport details
- Loading dates and ETAs
- Their own items in containers
- Item descriptions, quantities, measurements
- Delivery status

**Customers Cannot See:**
- Other customers' items
- Internal costs and rates
- Admin actions and controls
- Containers without their goods

## Technical Details

### Type Safety
- Uses `BackendCargoContainer` type for consistency
- Proper error handling with fallback empty states
- TypeScript-enforced API contracts

### Error Handling
- All service methods wrapped in try-catch
- Returns empty results instead of throwing
- Console logging for debugging
- Toast notifications for user feedback

### Performance
- Paginated results (default 100 per page)
- Efficient filtering at backend level
- Lazy loading for container items
- Dashboard stats cached per request

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Customer can see "My Goods" in sidebar
- [ ] Sea cargo page loads containers
- [ ] Air cargo page loads containers
- [ ] Clicking container navigates to details

- [ ] Search works correctly
- [ ] Status filters work
- [ ] Dashboard stats display correctly
- [ ] Empty state shows when no containers
- [ ] Admins cannot access customer cargo routes

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)
1. Add export functionality for customer cargo data
2. Add email notifications when goods arrive
3. Add tracking history timeline
4. Add document download links
5. Add claims filing from container details
6. Add real-time status updates via WebSocket
